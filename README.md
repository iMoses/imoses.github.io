# iMoses.me - Ido Moshe

With over 20 years of experience as a Fullstack engineer, I have a strong background in developing complex web applications and a keen eye for pixel-perfect design. I have been fortunate enough to be a founding team member at three startups, gaining valuable experience and knowledge about the process of bringing a product from concept to fruition. In addition, I also act as a UX engineer, focused on creating intuitive and user-friendly experiences.

I have always been passionate about technology and its ability to automate problem solving and improve people's lives. This passion has driven me to continuously learn and grow as a developer, and I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and expand my skill set. I have a strong desire to stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends and am always seeking out opportunities for professional development.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am a confident communicator that thrives in collaborative environments. I am skilled at communicating complex technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders and believe that my ability to lead and work well with others is just as important as my technical skills. I strive to create an inclusive and positive work culture wherever I go and am a strong believer in the power of teamwork. I believe that bringing people together and fostering open communication is key to achieving success.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family and engaging in outdoor activities. I am an avid reader and enjoy learning about a wide range of subjects, from software development to astrophysics. I also enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures, as I believe it helps broaden my perspective and allows me to bring fresh ideas to my work.

I am excited at the prospect of joining a dynamic and forward-thinking team, and I believe that my skills and experiences make me an ideal fit for a Technical Lead position. I am confident that I have the necessary skills and experience to make a positive impact on your team and help drive the success of your projects. I am looking forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and experience to your team and help bring your projects to the next level.
