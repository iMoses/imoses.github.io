# iMoses.me - Personal Website

As an experienced founding team member at multiple startups, I am well versed in leading and executing web-related
development processes end-to-end, and while recognised as a full-stack generalist with vast experience in system
architecture and design, my expertise lies in developing pixel-perfect user interfaces with high regard to the users
experience.

I'd say my biggest passion is towards infrastructure and interfaces, no matter what stack I'm working on. Directly influencing the daily experience of both developers and users is what keeps me content at work.
