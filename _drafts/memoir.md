I remember the first time I ruined a PC just as I can remember the first time I disassembled a wristwatch and failed
to put it back together. I was about 9 when I've learned at school what a screen resolution is and how to configure
it on Windows 3.11, so it was only reasonable I'd try that at home. Long story short, after my mother specifically
threatened me not to ruin her work computer I had to pay the local "computer guy" from my allowance so he'll teach me
how to manually edit Windows `ini` configuration file. It's a good thing they added in Windows 95 the "Do you want to keep these
settings" prompt with an auto-revert.

I started writing code at 10 (**Visual Basic 6.0**) and developed my first website at 11, using the latest
technologies such as **HTML 4.01** and [**JScript**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript).
